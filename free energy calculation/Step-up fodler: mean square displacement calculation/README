This file contains the input necessary to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) for NaCl, KCl, and Na-K-Cl. 
These MSD values are essential for our free energy calculations.

To proceed, we need to integrate the machine learning potential with the MOMB pair potential in LAMMPS, 
as the MOMB potential shares the same functional form as the DFT-D2 method. 

Detailed information about the DFT-D2 parameters can be found in the attached paper within this folder.
