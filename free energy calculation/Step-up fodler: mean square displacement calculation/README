This file contains the input necessary to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) for NaCl, KCl, and Na-K-Cl. 
These MSD values are essential for our free energy calculations.

To proceed, we need to integrate the machine learning potential with the MOMB pair potential in LAMMPS, 
as the MOMB potential shares the same functional form as the DFT-D2 method. 

Detailed information about the DFT-D2 parameters can be found in the attached paper within this folder. 
Alternatively, you can download the paper using the following link: [Download the research paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.20495)


In the NaCl_mean_square_displacement folder, you’ll find various subfolders, each containing files for calculating the mean square displacement (MSD) at different temperatures. 
I’ll use the 100 folder as an example to explain the contents.
     in.run: This file is the input script for LAMMPS, setting up and running the simulation.
     output.run: This file contains the complete output from the LAMMPS simulation.
Key information related to the MSD calculations is extracted from the output.run file and saved in the result file.
     In the result file, the MSD values for each atomic species (Na, Cl, and K) are stored in the last three columns, respectively.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance (sunhao20110920@126.com).
