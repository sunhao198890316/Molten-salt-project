This directory provides a detailed overview of the free energy calculations, organized into subfolders, each serving a specific purpose:

            Step-up fodler: mean square displacement (MSD) calculation: 
            Contains input files and results used to calculate the MSD at various temperatures. 
            These values are crucial for determining the spring constants used in modeling Einstein crystals at different temperatures.

            Free energy calculation
            This folder includes input files and results for free energy calculations conducted at different temperatures, all based on a 5×5×5 NaCl model. 
            The spring constants used in these calculations are derived from the MSD values obtained in the "MSD" folder.

            Rescaling calculation
            This folder contains the input files and results for calculating the temperature dependence of free energy. 
            The approach involves starting at a specific temperature and determining the free energy across a range of temperatures in a single simulation.
            However, the starting temperature is crucial and cannot be arbitrary. 
            If the temperature is too low, atomic motion is insufficient (both in speed and range), leading to inaccurate averages. 
            To ensure reliable results, the starting temperature should generally exceed the Debye temperature or be as high as practical.
            Finally, avoid excessive scaling—typically, 300 K is reasonable.
